I am a computer nerd who loves everything about computers for a long, long time. I love to program ever since I was eight, and do it today too. My dream is to help the world find a better place. This is why, I will always be 100% open-source. Unless, I wish to implement an Easter egg, in which I will not post references to them publicly, until, they are found. \r\nI believe that the world is a VERY corrupt place, and companies such as [Google](http://google.com), [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com), and [Apple](http://apple.com), are certainly no exception. Apple is a fraud, Microsoft is evil, and Google is the NSA! I will never force someone to take my products, nor will I ever, EVER implement any stalkers into any of my programs. Even the license says so!\r\n## Why Java?\r\nFor the other nerds out there, I use Java for two main reasons. A.) [Minecraft](minecraft.net) and B.) Compare the following statements. C++: `std::cout<<\"abcd\"<<endl;` vs Java: `System.out.println(\"abcd\");`. See the difference?","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
